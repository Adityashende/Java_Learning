OOP's in Java

Object simply means a real-world entity such as fan,chair,laptop etc.
So what is onject oriented programming or paradigm means ??

==> It simple word we can say that a method to design a program using classes and objects.It helps the programmer to simplify the deveolopment and maintainance by providing certain concepts such as:

* Objects
* class
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation

With the help of the above concept we can implement our object-oriented programming in our development of any application/software.

Apart form these there are few more concept which we can used to implement object-oriented design. We will discuss this topic further in this leraning.

Let's start with basics:

**> Objects : A object is something which has state and behaviour.It has data and its behaviour i.e methods.

For Example: Object:House is an object and that house has Address,color which is known as "state" and "behaviour" for house is opening door,closing the door etc.

Lets understand with the code :

State can be represented as instance variable and behaviour as methods

class House {

	String address;
	String color;

	void openDoor(){
	
	//Implementation goes here;

 }
	void closeDoor(){

	//Implementation goes here;
 }
}

So in the above example openDoor and closeDoor are methods and address,color are instance variable.

What is instance variable ?

==> The variable which are declared inside the class but outside the constructor,block,methods.
Instance variable are created when an object is instantiated and are accessible to all constructor,methods, blocks in the class.

==> There are three ways to initialize java :

1.By Reference variable
2.By Methods
3.By Constructor

Imp***:The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. All objects get memory in Heap memory area.

**> Class : We can say that a class is a blueprint from which objects are created.
	It is a logical entity.
	It is a group of objects with common properties.

A class in java can contain :

=> Fields
=> Methods
=> Constructors
=> Blocks
=> Nested class and interface


Synatx : class 'className'{

		fields;
		Methods;
	}
**> Methods in java:

==> Methods in java is like function which is used to defined the behaviour of an object.
	
**> "this" keyword in java :

==> 'this' is a reference variable used to refer the current object.

"this keyword" is used for differnt purpose in java:

--> it can be used to refer current class instance variable.
--> it can be used to invoke current class method implicitily.
--> this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.
--> it can also be passed as an argument in method call.
--> it can also be passed as an argument in constructor call
--> this can be used to retrun current class instance from the method.

"Formal parameters in java are the parameters which are given in the definition of the methods."
 
For Example: Let us assume that a function B() is called from another function A(). In this case A is called the “caller function” and B is called the “called function or callee function”. Also, the arguments which A sends to B are called actual arguments and the parameters of B are called formal arguments.

In short,this keyword is used to differentiate b/w local variable and instance variable

**> Constructors: 

==> It is the special type of method to initailize the object.
    Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
    It calls a dfault constructor if there is no constructor available in the class.If no constructor is defined then java compiler provides default contructor.
It is called constructor because it constructs the values at the time of object creation

There are two types of constructors in Java: no-arg constructor, and parameterized constructor.

Rules for constructor:

1. Constructor name must be the same as its class name
2. A Constructor must have no explicit return type
3. A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
