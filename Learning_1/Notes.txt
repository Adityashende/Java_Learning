OOP's in Java

Object simply means a real-world entity such as fan,chair,laptop etc.
So what is onject oriented programming or paradigm means ??

==> It simple word we can say that a method to design a program using classes and objects.It helps the programmer to simplify the deveolopment and maintainance by providing certain concepts such as:

* Objects
* class
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation

With the help of the above concept we can implement our object-oriented programming in our development of any application/software.

Apart form these there are few more concept which we can used to implement object-oriented design. We will discuss this topic further in this leraning.

Let's start with basics:

* Objects : A object is something which has state and behaviour.It has data and its behaviour i.e methods.

For Example: Object:House is an object and that house has Address,color which is known as "state" and "behaviour" for house is opening door,closing the door etc.

Lets understand with the code :

State can be represented as instance variable and behaviour as methods

class House {

	String address;
	String color;

	void openDoor(){
	
	//Implementation goes here;

 }
	void closeDoor(){

	//Implementation goes here;
 }
}

So in the above example openDoor and closeDoor are methods and address,color are instance variable.

What is instance variable ?

==> The variable which are declared inside the class but outside the constructor,block,methods.
Instance variable are created when an object is instantiated and are accessible to all constructor,methods, blocks in the class.
